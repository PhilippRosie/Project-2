                    ROSBY started as brand in the end of July 2017 and the reason I launched Rosby was that I felt that todays brands always 
                    looks at the commercial concept of clothes instead of the people that wears them. Your first impression is the most 
                    important one, so to be able to reflect your personality in the style and clothes you’re wearing has always been very 
                    important for me. Instead of being a part of todays trend, YOU make it.

                    I was born in Helsingborg Sweden in 1989. Since a very young age I have always been interested in art and how designers incorporate it into everyday life, this lead to my passion for designing later in life.
                    In my first weeks of kindergarten when I was 6 years old I understood quite fast that this world could be cruel. I had a hard time fitting in and making friends with the other children in my class, this lead to me being an outsider and not long after I became an easy target for bullying. This went on for some time, it wasn’t until I went to high school that I started being able to stand my ground and develop the foundation that would later become my personality. I started getting friends and my social life took a step for the better.
                    Being in a group of friend and having fun felt amazing, but it was now I started to see how mistreated other people in my surroundings where. I decided to become the one to stand up towards the bullies when the ones being prosecuted couldn’t.
                    You might think that I wish to make my school years disappear, funny thing is I don’t look back at it in anger, I’m glad that I got to be the target so others didn’t, it was thanks to the horrible actions of others that many years later made my vision of Rosby so clear. An idea was born, to help as many people as possible when they cant help themselves. A lot of men and women have great difficulties expressing themselves, they might feel that they need to follow the stream and go for a fashion trend that might not fit them personally.
                    If Rosby could help others being more true to themselves and not something that other people wants them to be, that would bring me great joy.
